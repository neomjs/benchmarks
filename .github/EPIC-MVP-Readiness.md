# Epic: MVP Readiness for Performance Showcases

**Goal:** To ensure the benchmark project is polished, documented, and ready for a public launch to showcase Neo.mjs's performance advantages. This epic focuses on the final steps to make the benchmarks easily understandable, reproducible, and credible to an external audience.

---

## 1. Finalize Benchmark Implementations

-   [ ] Task: Review and Finalize All Framework Implementations:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Ensure the Angular, React, and Neo.mjs apps are using comparable, best-practice implementations for a fair comparison.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Document the key libraries and versions used for each framework (e.g., React v18, Angular v17, TanStack Virtual v8).
    -   [ ] Sub-task: For the Neo.mjs big data app, offload data generation to a dedicated task worker to prevent the app worker from freezing and ensure UI responsiveness during heavy computations.
-   [ ] Task: Add an AG Grid version of the React benchmark:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Implement an additional version of the React benchmark using AG Grid to provide a comparison with a feature-rich grid library.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Keep the existing TanStack Virtual benchmark for comparison with a lightweight, "headless" library.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Update the reports and documentation to include the new AG Grid benchmark.

## 2. Polish Reporting and Documentation

-   [ ] Task: Enhance Benchmark Reports:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Review the `COMBINED_BENCHMARK_REPORT.md`. Ensure it's easy to read, the key takeaways are highlighted at the top, and the compared frameworks are clearly specified (e.g., "React & TanStack Virtual", "Angular & AG Grid").
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Add a "How to Read This Report" section to explain the metrics (e.g., `avgTimeToValidState`, `rowLag`).
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Generate final, canonical benchmark results for the MVP launch.
-   [ ] Task: Create Comprehensive Project Documentation:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Update the main `README.md` to be the central entry point for the project. It should clearly state the project's purpose and link to the benchmark results and methodology.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a `METHODOLOGY.md` file that explains the "why" behind the benchmark design, referencing the "Time to Valid State" and "High-Fidelity Scroll Measurement" concepts from the technical epic.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` file with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the benchmarks.

## 3. Credibility and Promotion


-   [ ] Task: Prepare Promotional Materials:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Write a blog post or article summarizing the key findings of the benchmarks.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a short video screencast demonstrating the interactive benchmark, highlighting the UI fluidity of Neo.mjs vs. the freezing/crashing of others.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Publish all source code to a public GitHub repository.

## 4. Project Cleanup and Final Review

-   [ ] Task: Code and Repository Cleanup:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Remove any temporary files, old scripts, or unused code.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Ensure all file and directory names are clear and self-explanatory.
-   [ ] Task: Restructure apps directory for scalability:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a new `apps/interactive` directory.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Move the existing interactive benchmark apps into it.
-   [ ] Task: Final MVP Review:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Perform a final review of all user-facing materials (reports, documentation) for clarity, accuracy, and typos.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Get a final "go" from the project owner before public launch.

## 5. New Benchmark Scenarios
-   [ ] Task: Develop a "Big Data" benchmark scenario based on the existing `apps/bigData` application:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create tests for a grid with up to 20 million cells, using the existing runtime controls (e.g., 100,000 rows x 200 columns).
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Add a "real-time feed" feature to continuously update a subset of data while the grid is being interacted with.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create comparable implementations for Angular and React that also support runtime configuration of rows and columns and a real-time feed.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Add the new benchmark to the reporting.

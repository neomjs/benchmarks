# Epic: MVP Readiness for Performance Showcases

**Goal:** To ensure the benchmark project is polished, documented, and ready for a public launch to showcase Neo.mjs's performance advantages. This epic focuses on the final steps to make the benchmarks easily understandable, reproducible, and credible to an external audience.

---

## 1. Finalize Benchmark Implementations

-   [~] Task: Review and Finalize All Framework Implementations:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Ensure the Angular, React, and Neo.mjs apps are using comparable, best-practice implementations for a fair comparison.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Document the key libraries and versions used for each framework (e.g., React v18, Angular v17, TanStack Virtual v8).
    -   [ ] Sub-task: For the Neo.mjs big data app, offload data generation to a dedicated task worker to prevent the app worker from freezing and ensure UI responsiveness during heavy computations. (The React implementation can be used as a blueprint).
-   [x] Task: Add an AG Grid version of the React benchmark:
    -   [x] Sub-task: Implement an additional version of the React benchmark using AG Grid to provide a comparison with a feature-rich grid library. (Done for the Big Data benchmark)
    -   [x] Sub-task: Keep the existing TanStack Virtual benchmark for comparison with a lightweight, "headless" library. (The interactive benchmark uses TanStack)
    -   [~] Sub-task: Update the reports and documentation to include the new AG Grid benchmark. (Benchmark results are in, but not yet in the combined report)

## 2. Polish Reporting and Documentation

-   [ ] Task: Enhance Benchmark Reports:
    -   *Note: This task is blocked until the new benchmark scenarios (scrolling, real-time feed) are implemented, as the report structure will change significantly.*
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Redesign the report structure to be more compelling and narrative-driven.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Add an "Executive Summary" with key takeaways at the top of each report.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: In result tables, add a comparative "Neo.mjs Advantage" column (e.g., "X times faster").
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Add a "User Experience" column with relatable descriptions (e.g., "Instant", "Sluggish").
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Add a section explaining the architectural "Why" behind the performance differences.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Update the reporting scripts to automatically generate this new, richer format.
-   [ ] Task: Create Comprehensive Project Documentation:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Update the main `README.md` to be the central entry point for the project. It should clearly state the project's purpose and link to the benchmark results and methodology.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a `METHODOLOGY.md` file that explains the "why" behind the benchmark design, referencing the "Time to Valid State" and "High-Fidelity Scroll Measurement" concepts from the technical epic.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` file with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the benchmarks.

## 3. Credibility and Promotion


-   [ ] Task: Prepare Promotional Materials:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Write a blog post or article summarizing the key findings of the benchmarks.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a short video screencast demonstrating the interactive benchmark, highlighting the UI fluidity of Neo.mjs vs. the freezing/crashing of others.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Publish all source code to a public GitHub repository.

## 4. Project Cleanup and Final Review

-   [ ] Task: Code and Repository Cleanup:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Remove any temporary files, old scripts, or unused code.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Ensure all file and directory names are clear and self-explanatory.
-   [ ] Task: Restructure apps directory for scalability:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a new `apps/interactive` directory.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Move the existing interactive benchmark apps into it.
-   [ ] Task: Final MVP Review:
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Perform a final review of all user-facing materials (reports, documentation) for clarity, accuracy, and typos.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Get a final "go" from the project owner before public launch.
-   [ ] Task: Refactor Big Data benchmark tests for clarity and scalability.
    -   *Goal: Improve the credibility and maintainability of the tests by eliminating duplicated code and using a config-driven approach.*
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a shared test runner utility for the big data scenarios.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Move framework-specific details (selectors, URLs) into separate configuration files.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Simplify the main spec files to simply invoke the runner with the appropriate config.

## 5. New Benchmark Scenarios
-   [~] Task: Develop a "Big Data" benchmark scenario based on the existing `apps/bigData` application:
    -   [x] Sub-task: Create tests for a grid with up to 20 million cells, using the existing runtime controls (e.g., 100,000 rows x 200 columns). (Done for Neo.mjs and React)
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Add a "real-time feed" feature to continuously update a subset of data while the grid is being interacted with.
    -   [x] Sub-task: Create a comparable implementation for React using AG Grid that also supports runtime configuration of rows and columns. (Angular is not planned for this scenario)
    -   [~] Sub-task: Add the new benchmark to the reporting. (Results for Neo.mjs and React are available, but need to be integrated into the combined report)
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a "High-Fidelity Scrolling" benchmark test.
        -   *Goal: Automate the measurement of perceived performance during rapid, successive scrolling, capturing the time it takes for the grid to render all visible cells after the scroll actions (Time to Valid State).*
        -   [ ] Sub-task: Implement a Playwright test that performs a quick burst of short, multi-directional scrolls (e.g., 10 rows down, 10 cols right, etc.).
        -   [ ] Sub-task: For each grid, develop a reliable method to determine when all visible cells are fully rendered.
        -   [ ] Sub-task: Add the new "scrollPaintLag" metric to the benchmark reports.

-   [ ] **Task: Enterprise Grid Competitor Benchmarks**
    -   *Goal: Demonstrate how Neo.mjs performance compares against popular, feature-rich grid components in the React ecosystem.*
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Implement Syncfusion React Data Grid benchmark (pending license).
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Implement RevoGrid (React wrapper) benchmark.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Implement MUI X Data Grid (React) benchmark.

-   [ ] **Task: Framework Performance Showdown: Neo.mjs vs. Svelte**
    -   *Goal: Directly challenge the performance reputation of Svelte by showcasing Neo.mjs's superior capabilities in a high-stress, big data scenario.*
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Create a new Svelte benchmark application using the SVAR Grid.
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Ensure the test scenario is directly comparable to the Neo.mjs big data app (e.g., same data size, interactions, and performance measurements).
    -   [ ] Sub-task: Add the Svelte/SVAR benchmark to the reporting infrastructure.
